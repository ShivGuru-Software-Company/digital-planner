ALARM SOUND SETUP INSTRUCTIONS:
===============================

1. Download or create an alarm sound file in MP3 format
2. Name it exactly: alarm_sound.mp3
3. Place it in this folder: android/app/src/main/res/raw/
4. Replace this instruction file

The sound file should be:
- Short duration (3-5 seconds) as it will loop
- Clear and audible alarm tone
- Not too large (keep under 1MB for app size)

Example alarm sounds you can use:
- Classic beep-beep-beep
- Siren sound
- Bell ringing
- Buzzer sound

Once you add the alarm_sound.mp3 file, the alarm will automatically use it for ringing.
